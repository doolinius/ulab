Well hi! Looks like you're having fun with Unix pipes. 'cowsay' lets you pipe the output of a command to me, and I'll say it for you! Read the 'cowsay' man page to see other options, including having other ascii art characters say the words. 'lolcat' adds a rainbow of color to what may otherwise be some bland, boring white on black text. You can pipe the output of any command to 'lolcat'. 

Oh, and the boss said to tell you 'flag_3035', whatever that means.
